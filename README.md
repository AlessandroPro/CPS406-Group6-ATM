# Automated Teller Machine  
### CPS 406 Software Engineering Project

The goal of this project was to be introduced to the various roles and activties of a software engineering team. The chosen project was a simulation of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). Each group member held a specific role on the team as follows:


Client - Baheer Kamal <br>
Team Leader - Alessandro Profenna <br>
Requirements Engineer - Tolaz Hewa <br>
Developer - Markus Jeeger <br>
Developer - Otto Barbalho <br>
Tester - Mikhail Korchevskiy <br>

The project began in January 2016 with requirements gathering. From there, the software architecture and design were completed. The team then worked on programming the GUI through multiple development iterations along with consistent testing. It was decided that the fictional bank running the ATM software would be called 'Rams Bank International'.  
The software was successdully demoed in April 2016.

The GUI was coded using JavaFX in IntelliJ IDEA. All of the code is located in the /ATM_Machine directory.  
All documents and specifications are located in the /Miscellaneous directory.
